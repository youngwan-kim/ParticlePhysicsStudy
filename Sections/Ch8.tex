\begin{problem}{8.2}
In fixed-target electron-proton elastic scattering

\begin{align*}
    Q^2 = 2m_p \left(E_1-E_2\right) = 2m_p E_{1y} \andtxt Q^2 = 4E_1E_3 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Use these relations to show that 
    
    \begin{align*}
        \sin^2\frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{E_1}{E_3} \frac{m_p^2}{Q^2} y^2 \quad \text{and hence} \quad \frac{E_3}{E_1}\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2} = 1-y - \frac{m_p^2 y^2}{Q^2}.
    \end{align*}

    \item Assuming azimuthal symmetry and using Equations (7.31) and (7.32), show that
    
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\dif \sigma}{\dif Q^2} = \left|  \frac{\dif \Omega}{\dif Q^2} \right| \frac{\dif \sigma }{\dif \Omega} = \frac{\pi}{E_3^2} \frac{\dif\sigma}{\dif\Omega}
    \end{align*}

    \item Using the results of (a) and (b) show that the Rosenbluth equation,
    
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\dif\sigma}{\dif\Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4E_1^2 \sin^4\halftheta} \frac{E_3}{E_1} \left( \frac{G_E^2+\tau G_M^2}{1+\tau} \cos^2 \halftheta + 2\tau G_M^2 \sin^2\halftheta \right),
    \end{align*}\\
    can be written in the Lorentz-invariant form

    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\dif\sigma}{\dif\Omega} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{Q^4} \left[ \frac{G_E^2 + \tau G_M^2}{1+\tau} \left( 1 - y - \frac{m_p^2 y^2}{Q^2} \right) + \frac{1}{2}y^2 G_M^2 \right]

\begin{problem}{8.3}
    In fixed-target electron–proton inelastic scattering:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Show that the laboratory frame differential cross section for deep-inelastic scattering is related to the Lorentz-invariant differential cross section of Equation (8.11) by
        
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{\dif^2 \sigma}{\dif E_3 \dif \Omega} = \frac{E_1E_3}{\pi} \frac{\dif^2 \sigma}{\dif E_3 \dif Q^2} =  \frac{E_1E_3}{\pi} \frac{2m_px^2}{Q^2} \frac{\dif^2 \sigma}{\dif x \dif Q^2},
        \end{align*}\\
        where $E_1,E_3$ are the energies of the incoming and outgoing electron. 

        \item Show that
        
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{2m_p x^2}{Q^2} \cdot \frac{y^2}{2} = \frac{1}{m_p} \frac{E_3}{E_1} \sin^2 \halftheta \andtxt 1-y-\frac{m_p^2x^2y^2}{Q^2} = \frac{E_3}{E_1} \cos^2 \halftheta.
        \end{align*}

        \item Hence, show that the Lorentz-invariant cross section of Equation (8.11) becomes
        
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{\dif^2 \sigma}{\dif E_3 \dif \Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4E_1^2 \sin^4 \halftheta} \left[ \frac{F_2}{\nu}\cos^2\halftheta + \frac{2F_1}{m_p^2} \sin^2 \halftheta \right].
        \end{align*}

        \item A fixed-target ep scattering experiment consists of an electron beam of maximum energy $20 \GeV$ and a variable angle spectrometer that can detect scattered electrons with energies greater than $2 \GeV$. Find the range of values of θ over which deep inelastic scattering events can be studied at $x = 0.2$ and $Q^2 = 2 \GeV^2$

Figure 8.18 shows the raw measurements of the structure function $F_2(x)$ in low-energy electron-deuterium scattering. When combined with the measurements of Figure 8.11, it is found that
