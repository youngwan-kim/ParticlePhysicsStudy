\begin{problem}{3.1}
Calculate the energy of the $\mu^-$ produced in the decay at rest $\pi^- \rightarrow \mu\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$.
Assume $m_{\pi} = \mathrm{140 \ MeV}$, $m_{\mu} = \mathrm{106 \ MeV}$ and take $m_{\nu} \sim 0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let the four-momenta of the muon and the neutrino to be $p_1 = (E_1, 0, 0, E_2)$ and $p_2 = (E_2, 0, 0, -E_2)$.
In the pion rest frame, $E_1 + E_2 = m_{\pi}$ and from the muon mass constraint $m_{\mu}^2 = E_1^2 - E_2^2$.
Solving these equation gives 
$$E_1 = {m_{\pi}^2 + m_{\mu}^2 \over 2m_{\pi}} = \mathrm{110.13 \ GeV}$$.

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}{3.2}
For the decay $a \rightarrow 1 + 2$, show that the momenta of both daughter particles
in the centre-of mass frame $p^*$ are
$$p^* = {1 \over 2m_a}\sqrt{[m_a^2 - (m_1^2 + m_2^2)][m_a^2 - (m_1^2 - m_2^2)]}$$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let the four-momenta of the mother particle and the daughter particles to be
$p_a = (m_a, 0, 0, 0)$, $p_1 = (E_1, 0, 0, p^*)$, $p_2 = (E_2, 0, 0, -p^*)$
From the mass constraints, we get $E_1 + E_2 = m_a$, $E_1^2 - p^{*2} = m_1^2$, and 
$E_2^2 - p^{*2} = m_2^2$.

Since we have three unknown variables $E_1, E_2, p^*$ and three equations,
it is possible to get $p^*$ in terms of $m_a, m_1 \ \mathrm{and} \ m_2$, which gives
the desired solution.

\end{solution}
