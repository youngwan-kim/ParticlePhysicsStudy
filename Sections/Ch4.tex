\begin{problem}{4.1}
Show that
\begin{align*}
    \left[ \hat{\boldp}^2,\hat{\mathbf{r}}\times \hat{\boldp}\right]=0,
\end{align*}
and hence the Hamiltonian of the free-particle Schr√∂dinger equation commutes with the angular momentum operator.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
One could expand the given commutator as, 

\begin{align*}
    \left[ \hat{\boldp}^2 , \hat{\mathbf{r}} \times \hat{\boldp} \right] &=  \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a\hat{\boldp}_a,\epsilon_{abc}r_c \hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right]\\[0.15in]
        &= \epsilon_{abc}r_c \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a\hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right]\\[0.15in]
        &= \epsilon_{abc}r_c \left\{ \hat{\boldp}_a \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right] + \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right] \hat{\boldp}_a  \right\} \\[0.15in]
        &= \epsilon_{abc}r_c \left\{ \hat{\boldp}_a \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right] + \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right] \hat{\boldp}_a  \right\} \quad \impliedby  \left[ \hat{\boldp}_a,\hat{\boldp}_b \hat{\mathbf{c}} \right] = \delta_{ab} \hat{\mathbf{c}} - i \delta_{ac} \hat{\boldp}_b

\begin{problem}{4.2}
Show that $u_1$ and $u_2$ are orthogonal, i.e. $u_1^\dagger u_2 =0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Let us first denote 

\begin{align*}
    u_\uparrow = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\
        0
    \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad 
    u_\downarrow = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1
    \end{pmatrix} .
\end{align*}\\
One should note that $u_\uparrow^{\dagger}u_\downarrow = 0$. $u_1,u_2$ could also be expressed in terms of 

\begin{align*}
    u_1 = \begin{pmatrix}[1.25]
        u_\uparrow \\
        \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp}{E+m} u_\uparrow
    \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad 
    u_2 = \begin{pmatrix}[1.25]
        u_\downarrow \\
        \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp}{E+m} u_\downarrow
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}\\
Now $u_1^\dagger u_2$ could be written as, 

\begin{align*}
    u_1^\dagger u_2 &=  \begin{pmatrix}[1.25]
        u_\uparrow \\
        \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp}{E+m} u_\uparrow
    \end{pmatrix}^\dagger
    \begin{pmatrix}[1.25]
        u_\downarrow \\
        \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp}{E+m} u_\downarrow
    \end{pmatrix} \\[0.15in]
    &=  \begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        u_\uparrow^\dagger & \frac{1}{E+m} \left(\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) u_\uparrow\right)^\dagger
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}[1.25]
        u_\downarrow \\
        \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp}{E+m} u_\downarrow \\
    \end{pmatrix} \\[0.15in]
    &=  u_\uparrow^\dagger u_\downarrow + \frac{1}{\left(E+m\right)^2} \left(\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) u_\uparrow\right)^\dagger \left(\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) u_\downarrow\right) \\[0.15in]
    &=  u_\uparrow^\dagger u_\downarrow + \frac{1}{\left(E+m\right)^2}  u_\uparrow^\dagger \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right)^\dagger \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) u_\downarrow  
\end{align*}
One could use the fact that,

\begin{align*}
    \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right)^\dagger \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) =  \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right)^2 = \begin{pmatrix}[1.5]
        p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2 & 0 \\
        0 & p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2 \\
    \end{pmatrix} = \left(E^2-m^2\right)I_2
\end{align*}\\
Thus it could be tidied up as, 

\begin{align*}
    u_1^\dagger u_2 &=  u_\uparrow^\dagger u_\downarrow + \frac{1}{\left(E+m\right)^2}  u_\uparrow^\dagger \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right)^\dagger \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldp\right) u_\downarrow  \\[0.15in]
                    &= \left[ 1 + \frac{E^2-m^2}{\left(E+m\right)^2}  \right]  u_\uparrow^\dagger u_\downarrow = 0 \qed
\end{align*}

\begin{problem}{4.3}
Verify the statement that the Einstein energy-momentum relationship is recovered if any of the four Dirac spinors of (4.48)
are subtitutes into the Dirac equation written in terms of momentum, $\left( \gamma^\mu p_\mu-m \right)u=0$.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Let us choose $u_1$ to plug in the Dirac equation. Then it could be expressed as,

\begin{align*}
    \left(\slashed{p}-m\right)u_1 = 0 &\implies \begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        \left(E-m\right)I_2 & -\sigp \\
        \sigp & -\left(E+m\right) I_2 
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        E+m \\
        0 \\
        p_z \\
        p_x + ip_y 
    \end{pmatrix} = 0  \\[0.15in]
    &\implies \begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        E^2-m^2 \\
        0
    \end{pmatrix} + \sigp\begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        E+m-p_z \\
        -p_x -ip_y
    \end{pmatrix} - \left(E+m\right)\begin{pmatrix}[1.2]
        p_z \\
        p_x+ip_y
    \end{pmatrix} = 0 \\[0.15in]
    \text{[first row]} &\implies \left(E^2-m^2\right) + \left(E+m\right)p_z - \left(p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2\right) - \left(E+m\right) p_z = 0 \\[0.15in] 
    &\implies E^2 = p_x^2 +p_y^2 + p_z^2 +m^2  \qed
