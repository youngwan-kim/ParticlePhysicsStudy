\begin{problem}{5.1}
Draw the two time-ordered diagrams for the s-channel process shown in Figure 5.5. By repeating the steps of Section 5.1.1, show that the propagator has the same form as obtained for the t-channel process.\\

\noindent {\footnotesize Hint: one of the time-ordered diagrams is non-intuitive, remember that in second-order perturbation theory the intermediate state does not conserve energy.}
