# Selected Solutions to Modern Particle Physics 

Welcome to this particle physics self-study solution repository! 
This project is aimed at providing a resource for people who are interested in learning about particle physics. 
Whether you're a beginner or just looking for additional documentation, I hope you find this repository helpful on your learning journey.


## About

This repository contains solutions, notes, and explanations for the problems and concepts covered in the book **Modern Particle Physics** by Mark Thomson. 
This book is an excellent resource for understanding the fundamental concepts of particle physics and is highly recommended for anyone starting studying this field.

You can find the book on [Amazon](https://a.co/d/bVARRXf).

## Actions

This repository has an action that triggers $\LaTeX$ compilation when pushed, so downloading the artifacts from the latest build from [actions](https://github.com/youngwan-kim/ParticlePhysicsStudy/actions) will get you the latest version of the solution.
